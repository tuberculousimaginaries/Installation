# Tuberculous Imaginaries
## Artist's Statement

_Tuberculous Imaginaries_ is a response to a kind of medical image perpetuated, in part, by the rhetoric of the medical museum. These institutions promote a spectacular image of the human body, which sees it as something that stirs excitement and fear, curiosity and revulsion for the viewer. Whether it be early modern science’s “[book of the body](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/358129)”, the rise of the Parisian method of anatomy and the medical library, or the contemporary posthumous sideshow of Body Worlds. An implicit product of the grand staging of the human corps, is the issue of its sourcing—where did they acquire the organs that are sealed in spirit? And from whom did they pull the heart, bone, or sample of skin? Undergirding much of modern, western medical science is a silent actor: the patient from which knowledge, material, and argument is extracted, excised, or harvested. The bodies that would be anatomized, pathologized, and (literally) objectified were most commonly the dispossessed, the racialized other, and the most desperately ill. The patient as clinical material reinscribed and reinforced the value of the medical class, enabling medical researchers to emerge in the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries (depending on which western country you examine) as an esteemed (and profitable) profession.

_Tuberculous Imaginaries_ responds to this history by reconceiving how the primary artifact can be engaged by a public audience. Seeing museological practice as more than an enshrinement of unique artifacts and dominant histories, I have chosen to draw on various different kinds of discursive materials associated with tuberculosis research at the turn of the twentieth century. 
Each projector displays a different kind of image associated with the practice of normal science. Projector A shows pathological illustrations and clinical photographs. Projector B is made up of images of laboratories, pharmacies, and patient care; each image in this feed shows the body of medical researchers and practitioners, and care has been made to single them out, to make them the focus (sometimes at the expense of the image of the patient). Projector C consists of text generated with optical character recognition (OCR) of sections from the books that were excerpted for the video feeds of the other two projectors. Rather than enshrine these artifacts as authoritative, concrete specimens, I have taken care to respond to and reflect on the rhetoric employed by medical professionals in their discourses between other scientists and the public. I have outlined the protocol for each video feed below, following a call for codifying particular modes of critique by Max Liboiron.
My intent for this installation is not to disrupt or disprove modern medicine’s epistemics. The public good provided by medicine is significant—especially as we claw our way out of a global pandemic. My interest in this project (and with my more traditional research) is to understand how medicine produces and is produced by certain classes of people: how medicine inscribes and describes what is sickness, and how this practice reinforces certain prejudices through the practices of scientific racism and universalism.
One final note: I have attempted to short circuit the spectacular exploitation of the sick, dying and dead patient with care to not show the patient in exploitative, dehumanizing, and humiliating positions. In a previous [photo essay](https://epoiesen.library.carleton.ca/2022/01/10/dermographic-opacities/) (and early draft of the [current project](https://idah.indiana.edu/news-events/_symposia/spring-2021/purcell-sean.html) which was originally called [_Terminal Imaginaries_](https://terminalimaginaries.com/)) I more openly displayed the patient, and the various contortions the patient experienced when made into a specimen by medical researchers. I have left some images that show the patient in this installation, but at times I actively erase their physiognomy to emphasize the position of the doctor in those same frames. My intent for this project is not to continue to do violence to those who suffered from illness and the humiliations of the clinical gaze; instead, I hope to concretely show the ways medical professionals are imaged and imagined in relation to their work.
